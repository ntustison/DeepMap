The following overview of deep learning image registration methods is categorized
based on the discussion of network architectures given in the previous section
with subgranularity provided in terms of loss function.
We first discuss early work in which transformations were derived
from CNN-based identification and localization of corresponding features in
image pairs.  We then review two channel approaches in which fixed and moving images
are concatenated channelwise in the input layer.  This segues to
methods involving the related siamese and pseudo-siamese architectures.  The final
category concerns those adverserial approaches employing GANs.  Other methods which
do not fit in any of the above categories are also discussed.
