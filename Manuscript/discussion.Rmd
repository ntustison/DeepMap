In the introduction, we mentioned the relative lack of development in the
field image registration.  It is natural to ask why this is the case.
Is it possible that deep learning is reducing the algorithmic contribution
of image registration and corresponding development?  For example, prior
to the introduction of segmentation


For years, image registration has been an extremely important tool for quantitative
medical image analysis, in part, due to the role it played in incorporating spatial
prior information for subsequent processing.  However, deep learning is capable of
doing many of those things without reference to
