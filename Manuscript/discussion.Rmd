For years, image registration has been an important tool for quantitative
medical image analysis, in part, due to the role it played in incorporating spatial
prior information for subsequent processing.  However, deep learning is capable of
doing many of those things without reference to


_Maybe discuss the trajectory of traditional image registration and how we
progressed from the optical flow and elastic matching to large deformations
with diffeomorphisms.  Discuss the analogy with deep learning_

_Discuss deep regression paper here._

_Discuss availability of packages such as NiftyNet, ANTsRNet_

The recently renewed interest in deep learning has resulted in much progress
with




In the introduction, we mentioned the relative lack of development in the
field image registration.  It is natural to ask why this is the case.
Is it possible that deep learning is reducing the algorithmic contribution
of image registration and corresponding development?  For example, prior
to the introduction of segmentation
