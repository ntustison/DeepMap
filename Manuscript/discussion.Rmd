The rich history of image registration illustrates the significant role that it has
played in the field of quantitative medical image analysis.  This history is punctuated
by many research developments, both small and great, which have resulted in transformations
of greater accuracy, improved computational efficiency, and
enlightening theoretical novelty---all of which improves the community's ability to do science.  In
addition, the open-source emphasis of the current scientific environment has improved
the didactic quality and availability of these contributions which democratizes
such technologies and, in effect, acts as a positive feedback loop by leading to future
methodological advancements.

The recent resurgence of deep learning and, in particular, its CNN-based applications in medical
imaging appears to be of paradigmatic significance.  The ability to train networks to perform
complicated tasks efficiently without the need of hand-tailoring image features has disrupted
the current research landscape as evidenced by deep learning representation in conference
presentations and manuscripts.  This significance appears to extend to the
domain of image registration, although it is still too early to determine the precise nature
of this impact.

The recently renewed interest in deep learning has resulted in much progress
with




In the introduction, we mentioned the relative lack of development in the
field image registration.  It is natural to ask why this is the case.
Is it possible that deep learning is reducing the algorithmic contribution
of image registration and corresponding development?  For example, prior
to the introduction of segmentation
