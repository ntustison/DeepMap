# Introduction

Determining the spatial correspondence between imaging domains is frequently a
critical component in quantitative image analysis workflows.  The evolution of
image registration theoretical and technological development has led to increasingly
high quality transformational mappings that have significantly improved performance in related
processing tasks (e.g., image segmentation via joint label fusion [@Iglesias:2015aa])
and imaging-based statistical analysis strategies (e.g., sparse canonical correlation
analysis [@Avants:2010aa]).  Several reviews
[@Brown:1992;@Maintz:1998aa;@Pluim:2003aa;@Gholipour:2007aa;@Viergever:2016aa;@Keszei:2017aa]
have charted this chronology and provided insight into related issues such as algorithmic
classification, available implementations, relevant evaluation strategies, and speculation
concerning future directions of the field.  Although prescient in many respects,
even in later reviews, speculation vis-Ã -vis deep learning was somewhat limited almost
certainly due to  its relatively recent and sudden overwhelming of the field in terms
of popularity and research focus.

Although the foundational concepts that form the basis for modern deep learning
architectures are historically well-established, it is only recently that
hardware availability has made sufficient advancements to meet the computational
requirements of deep learning applications.
