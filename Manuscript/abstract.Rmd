Recent methodological innovations in deep learning and associated advancements in computational
hardware have significantly impacted the various core subfields of quantitative medical image
analysis.  The generalizability, computational efficiency and open-source
availability of deep learning algorithms and related software, particularly those utilizing convolutional neural
networks, have produced paradigm shifts within the field.  This impact is evident from topical prevalance
in the literature, conference and workshop themes and winning methodologies in relevant competitions.
In this work, we review the various state-of-the-art approaches to learning and prediction
and/or optimizing image transformations using convolutional neural networks.   Although of
primary importance within the
quantitative imaging domain, image registration algorithmic development, in the context of these
deep learning strategies, has received comparatively less attention than its counterparts (e.g.,
image segmentation).  Nevertheless, significant progress has been made in this particular subfield
which has been presented in various research venues.  We contextualize these contributions within the broader scope of
deep learning advancements and, in so doing, attempt to facilitate the leveraging and further
development of such techniques within the medical imaging research community.
